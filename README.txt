Installation Instructions:

Hopefully you unzipped into your mIRC directory, if you did NOT please either move the WP MP3 Player folder
to your mIRC directory or unzip the zip again, this time to your mIRC dir. (You can also choose a 
subdirectory of mIRC (eg. C:\mirc\sripts\coolscripts\mp3players\.....\ ) Unzipping will create a folder called WP MP3 Player.)
